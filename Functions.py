#A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.A function can return data as a result.
#CREATING FUNCTIONS
#In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:

def my_function():
  print("Hello from function")

#CALLING A FUNCTION
#To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:
def my_function():
  print("Hello from function")
my_function()

#ARGUMENTS
#Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
#Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

def my_function(fname):
  print(fname+ "Refsness")
my_function("Email")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linux")
# PARAMETERS (OR) ARGUMENTS
#The terms parameter and argument can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.
#From a function's perspective:
#A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
#An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
