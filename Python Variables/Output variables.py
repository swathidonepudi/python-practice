x = "You are beautiful" #the Python print() function is often used to output variables
print(x)

x = "You"  #in the Print() function, you have multiple variables seperated by comma:
y = "are"
z = "beautiful"
print(x,y,z)

x = "You" # you can also use the + operator to output multiple variables
y = "are"
z = "beautiful"
print(x+y+z)

x = 3  #For numbers the + character works as a Mathematical operator
y = 3
print(x+y)

x = 2  #The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
y = "Swathi"
print(x,y)
